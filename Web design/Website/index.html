							The Magnus Carlsen Chess Club, founded by the world’s leading chess player, Magnus Carsen himself, is certainly the most famous chess club here in Ireland, containing a high calibre of elite players around the world like no other. According to a variety of sources such as the world chess organisation, we are currently scored as the highest chess club in the world, from a competitive standpoint. However, the Magnus Carlsen chess club does not solely offer professional players the opportunity to further strengthen their expertise. We encourage beginners of all ages to pick up this sport, as we believe that chess is something that can benefit a child as much as it would, an adult. We welcome all of you to view the contents of this page and perhaps pay a visit to us in the near future!
